                    Pre-Built Tinker Executables for Windows
                    Version 8.10.2
                    ########################################

        This subdirectory contains compressed 64-bit Tinker executables
        for Intel-compatible machines running under Windows XP or later.
        The files can be expanded to .EXE files using any of the common
        ZIP compression/expansion utilities. Each executable is provided
        as a separate ZIP'd file. The programs were built using the MinGW
        GNU gfortran compiler. The executables will run from the command
        line within a Command Prompt window or via the Cygwin shell, and
        will not work with the Force Field Explorer Tinker interface.

        Please note that in order to use the Tinker package, other files
        are required. In particular, force field parameter sets, examples
        and test cases, and documentation can be found as part of the full
        distribution on http://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/. Source code is
        also provided in case you want to build a customized version.

        The Tinker executables are dimensioned to 1 million atoms maximum.
        Other, more restrictive, limits apply to certain memory intensive
        programs. The limits have been increased at the request of many
        users. Since Tinker is written in static allocated Fortran and
        makes no attempt to manage its own memory usage, your computer
        must make available at startup all the memory or virtual memory
        the Tinker programs might eventually require. Instructions for
        changing the virtual memory size on most versions of Windows are
        readily available on the Internet.

        If larger or smaller versions of the executables are desired, it
        is straightforward to change master dimensions in the "sizes.i"
        source file and build your own set of executables using the MinGW
        gfortran compiler or a commercial Fortran compiler such as Intel,
        PGI, Absoft or Lahey.
