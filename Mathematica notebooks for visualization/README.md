# Mathematica notebooks for visualization

This directory contains Mathematica notebooks for visualizing the results of the calculation pipeline. Use of these notebooks requires a valid license for Mathematica version 13.

  * *Eij_ListLines.nb* - Notebook that generates a plot for each calculated dimer, plotting the minimum sampled energy configuration (in red) and the average interaction energy at a specific distance against the corresponding distance.
  * *Plot_Zij.nb* -  Notebook that generates a plot for each dimer, plotting the averaged coordination number against the number of simulation steps.
  * *Visualize_lowest_energy_configurations.nb* - Notebook that exports both the minimum sampled energy configuration and the minimum energy configuration for each dimer as png and svg files.
